 There are many acronyms and terminology used throughout this document,
 the reader is adviced to familiarize themselves with the Terminology section
 before reading.
 There are also several other documentation materials provided with the
 FLA.
 The reader is encouraged to examin all documents before using the FLA to
 help ensure the most data, and most accurate data is retrieved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Field Guide provides an overview for use of the FLA in typical senarios.
 This section also provides troubleshooting advice for common problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ECM Quick References provide a very brief step-by-step guide to aquiring
 data from different ECMs.

 It is used when the FLA cannot communicate with the vehicle due to damaged
 wiring.
 The SSS reduces the chance the ECM will throw a fault compared to a standard
 calibration harness.
 SSSs are specific to a type of ECM.

Familiarize yourself with the FLA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the operator has preformed these steps, the FLA is ready for field
 use.
 The best way to maxamize the validity and completeness of data collected,
 the operator is advised to continue reading this manual.
 After the user is familiar with this, the best way to get confortable with
 using the FLA is to practice.
 This manual, and the other supporting documents will help guide operators
 through the download and review process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Using the FLA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The FLA is a powerful data extraction device, with many features.
 This section will teach the reader about the FLA, how to use it, and the
 features of the FLA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Specifications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Forensic Link Adapter is based on a powerful processor based on the
 Texas Instruments AM335x 1GHz ARM® Cortex-A8 Processor.
 It has 512MB of DDR3 RAM, 16 GB of internal storage, the NEON floating-point
 accelerator and 2 PRU 32-bit microcontrollers.
 The device has 2 Controller Area Network (CAN) channels, 2 J1708 Serial
 Channels, 100/10 Mbps Ethernet, USB 2.0, and a full implementation of the
 DG tech DPA4+ for RP1210 Compliance.
 The device has a GPS receiver, Real Time Clock, an accelerometer, and a
 rate Gyro.
 The display uses Organic LEDs for better sunlight readability.
 It runs embedded Linux and serves its own website.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Working with the Forensic Link Adapter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section will explain the basics of using the FLA.
 This is intended for new users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Powering Up
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The FLA will begin to boot whenever a power is supplied to the device.
 This can be done in one of three ways
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Using the vehicle connection cable to power the FLA using the battery of
 the vehicle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Using the wall adapter to power the FLA using a wall outlet
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Using the 12v cigarrette adapter to power the FLA either from a vehicle
 battery, or a portable battery pack
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The FLA can accept power from both the wall adapter or 12v cigarrett adapter
 and the vehicle connection cable at the same time.
 This is useful of an operator needs to preform several downloads in the
 same area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the FLA is finished booting, the device will display the title screen
 <pic of title_screen>.
 When this screen appears, the device is ready to opperate.
 If the device does not reach this screen in 60 seconds, see the troubleshooting
 section of this manual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once an investigator has established permission to download the data from
 a vehicle, the key needs to be turned to the on (not start) position for
 the FLA to communicate with the Electronic Control Modules (ECMs).
 The FLA can be plugged into the 9-pin diagnostic connector, which is usually
 located below the dash on the left side or to the left of the driver's
 seat.
 If the ECM was removed, then it should be connected through a Smart Sensor
 Simulator that emulates a truck.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Shutting Down
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Faulure to shut down the FLA correctly can cause a loss of data.

Almost all of the features of the FLA can be accessed through the main menu.
 The only two functions that are not avaliable are the FLA Support Mode,
 and previewing data, which are soly avaliable on the FLA Preview.
 Once the FLA boots, the device will enter the main menu, which contains
 the most used functions, such as running a scan, and uploading data.
 The below figure describes the layout of the FLA menu system.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The menu system of the FLA is dynamic, it will only give the operator the
 option to preform an action if the FLA detects the action is possible.
 i.e.
 the FLA will not allow the operator to initiate a vehicle scan if the FLA
 does not detect any network traffic.

\begin_layout Section
FLA Portal terminology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The FLA Portal has the following categories:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Organizations are the top level with a site administrator as the person
 in charge.
 Typically this is a highway patrol, a state police, or a company.
 The person in charge of the organization has the ability to oversee the
 data and use of the different FLAs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Groups are a sub-level within an organization.
 For example, East District and West District may be groups within an State
 Police organization.
 If an organization only has a few operators and a few FLAs, it may not
 make sense to have different groups.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Operators are trained users of the FLA and are responsible for collecting
 data in the field.
 Operators can be assigned to different groups.
 Every operator in the group is able to see the data packages from all the
 FLAs assigned to the group, regardless of which operators downloaded the
 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Forensic
\begin_inset space ~

Link

\end_inset

Adapters are the hardware devices that an organization owns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Account Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Forensic Link Adapters are assigned to each organization at the time of
 purchase.
 Once the organization completes the purchase, the serial numbers of each
 FLA will be loaded into the Organization's profile.
 An invitation to set up the Organization will be sent to the site administrator.
 For example, the Lieutenant in charge of the crash reconstruction division
 will become the site administrator once he or she registers by following
 the link sent in the invitation e-mail.

Adding an Operator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways to get an operator access to the group's FLAs.
 The first is to invite a new operator and the second is to invite an existing
 operator.
 However, the existing operator must have accepted an invitation from the
 Organization under a unique e-mail address.
 By clicking on the lower left box the says

\end_inset

, a web page similar to the one shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "fig:New-Operator-invitation"

\end_inset

.
 The required user information includes name and email address.
 The FLA portal uses e-mail addresses to identify operators.
 Therefore, if a person belongs to different organizations, they would have
 to use a different e-mail for each organization.
 New operators will get an e-mail from 
\family typewriter
fla-admin@synercontechnologies.com
\family default
 with a link to register with the site.
 Many times this e-mail will be filtered as junk, so advising the recipient
 to check their e-mail filters and junk folder may be necessary.
