\chapter*{About this Document}
\paragraph{  }
This manual is intended to teach the operator the features and use
of the Forensic Link Adapter (FLA). This is manual is designed as
a teaching tool, rather than a reference guide. There are many acronyms
and terminology used throughout this document, the reader is advised
to familiarize themselves with the Terminology section before reading.
There are also several accompanying documentation materials provided with
the FLA. It is suggested operators examine all documents before using
the FLA to help ensure the most data, and most accurate data is retrieved.
\section*{The Field Guide}
\paragraph{  }
The Field Guide provides an overview for use of the FLA in typical
scenarios. It is intended to be used as a reference for operating the FLA in the field. It also provides a troubleshooting section for common field issues.
problems.
\section*{The ECM Quick References}
\paragraph{  }
The ECM Quick References provide a very brief step-by-step guide to
acquiring data from different ECMs. These are intended to be quick
procedures for persons familiar with the FLA and general operations.


\part{Introduction to Synercon Products}


\chapter{Synercon Products}
\paragraph{  }
There are four main components of using Synercon Technologies products.
They will be referred to in the rest of this manual, so readers
are advised to familiarize themselves with these components to better understand the rest of this manual.
\paragraph{  }
The 4 Synercon products are
\begin{itemize}
\item The Forensic Link Adapter (FLA)
\item The FLA Preview
\item The FLA Portal
\item The Smart Sensor Simulator (SSS)
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{  }
All of these products work together to create an easy, secure system to extract data from heavy vehicles.
or an RP1210 interface to allow the operator to use OEM software.
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{../media/syercon_synergisics/single_laptop}
\end{center}
\newpage
\section{The Forensic Link Adapter (FLA)}
\vspace{1cm}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA is the device used to extract data from ECMs. The FLA is designed to extract data from ECMs in a forensically secure way. The FLA uses the SAE J1939 and SAE J1587 standards to communicate with ECMs. The FLA can extract data from ECMs by itself for select ECMs, meaning there is no need to carry a computer with OEM software to obtain data. For ECMs that the FLA cannot directly support, the FLA can be an RP1210 interface. This allows the operator to use OEM software to collect data through the FLA.

FLA Features
\begin{itemize}
\item Forensically secure data collection
\item Stand alone data collection for select ECMs
\item Easy to read OLED screen
\item Simple and durable two button interface
\item Built in GPS antenna
\end{itemize}
\newpage


\section{The FLA Preview}
\vspace{1cm}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA Preview provides an expanded interface to the FLA while out in the field. The FLA Preview is used to preview reports while in the field to confirm the operator has the data they wish to obtain. The FLA Preview is a website hosted by each FLA. It is accessed by
entering the IP address of the FLA into a web browser.
The FLA Preview can be accessed without an Internet connection.
\vspace{1cm}
\begin{center}

FLA Preview Features
\begin{itemize}
\item Ability to preview data in field
\item Ability to download event data from select ECMs
\item Ability to view old data that has been uploaded
\end{itemize}
\newpage

\section{The FLA Portal}
\vspace{1cm}
The FLA Portal is also referenced to as Synercon's Servers. This is
the website \url{https://fla.synercontechnologies.com}.
Data collected from the FLA is uploaded to this site, and operators
are able to view full reports here.
\vspace{1cm}
\begin{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item Reduces chances of throwing new faults during download
\item Provides reliable communications to ECMs
\item Can be brought to the field to eliminate the need to remove ECMs from vehicles.
\end{itemize}


\chapter{Getting Started}
\paragraph{  }
Congratulations on purchasing the only heavy vehicle scan tool purpose built for examining vehicles in a forensic or investigative context. This section provides a guide to getting the FLA System set up for the first time.


\section{What is Included with the FLA}


\subsection{The Contents of the FLA Case}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA Case has everything operators need to collect data from heavy vehicles. The FLA case has the following items:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{../media/graphics/cables_all}
\end{center}


\subsection{The FLA Portal and FLA Preview}
\paragraph{  }
The subscription to the TruckCrypt software allows operators to access the FLA Portal and FLA Preview. These will be discussed in more detail in section XXX.%TODO: fix with section labels.


\section{Register as an Operator}
\paragraph{  }
The fla-admin should send you an email to invite you to be an operator for your FLA on the FLA Portal. The fla-admin email is initiated by the Organization administrator inviting a new operator. For more details, please see Chapter XXX. It will be necessary to have a FLA Portal account to view any data you collect with your FLA.


\section{Operating the FLA}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA has a 4x20 character LCD screen, along with two buttons to
allow the user to interact with the device.


\subsection{Interacting with the FLA}

There are two general types of screens the FLA will display.
\\[\baselineskip]
\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}% adapt widths of minipages to your needs
\begin{center}
\textbf{Prompt Screens}
\end{center}
	The prompt screens will have one or two options on the last line, corresponding to the button on that side of the FLA.
\end{minipage}% 
\hfill% 
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth} 
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../media/graphics/fla_option_screen} 
\end{minipage}\\[\baselineskip]
\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}% adapt widths of minipages to your needs
\begin{center}
\textbf{Working Screens}
\end{center}
The working screens will not have an option on the last line, but usually a percentage bar. During these screens, the FLA is performing the operation displayed. \textbf{NOTE, during these screens the RED button can cancel the current task}.
\end{minipage}% 
\hfill% 
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth} 
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../media/fla_screens/ethernet_and_others/veh_scan/scan_25} 
\end{minipage}\\


\section{Familiarize yourself with the FLA}
\paragraph{  }
After the operator has performed these steps, the FLA is ready for
field use. To maximize the validity and completeness
of data collected, the operator is advised to continue reading this
manual. After the user is familiar with this, the best way to get
comfortable with using the FLA is to practice. This manual, and the
other supporting documents will help guide operators through the data collection and review process.


\chapter{Using the FLA}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA is a powerful data extraction device, with many features.
This section will teach the reader about the FLA, how to use it, and the features of the FLA.


\section{Working with the Forensic Link Adapter}
\paragraph{  }
This section will explain the basics of using the FLA. This section is is intended for users with little experience operating the FLA.


\subsection{Powering Up}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA will begin to boot whenever a power is supplied to the device. This can be done in one of three ways
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using the vehicle connection cable to power the FLA using the battery
of the vehicle
\item Using the wall adapter to power the FLA using a wall outlet
\item Using the 12v cigarette adapter to power the FLA either from a vehicle
battery, or a portable battery pack
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA can accept power from both the wall adapter or 12v cigarette adapter and the vehicle connection cable at the same time. This is useful of an operator needs to perform several downloads in the same area.
\\[\baselineskip]
\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}% adapt widths of minipages to your needs
%	\begin{center}
%		\textbf{5}
%	\end{center}
	Once the FLA is finished booting, the device will display the title screen
\end{minipage}% 
\hfill% 
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth} 
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../media/fla_screens/ethernet_and_others/main/title_both}
\end{minipage}\\[\baselineskip]
\paragraph{  }
When this screen appears, the device is ready to operate. If the device does not reach this screen in 60 seconds, see the troubleshooting section of this manual.
\paragraph{  }
Once an investigator has established permission to download the data from a vehicle, the key needs to be turned to the on (not start) position for the FLA to communicate with the Electronic Control Modules (ECMs).
\paragraph{  }
The FLA can be plugged into the 9-pin diagnostic connector, which is usually located below the dash on the left side or to the left of the driver's seat. If the ECM was removed, then it should be connected through a Smart Sensor Simulator that emulates a truck. 


\subsection{Shutting Down}

Failure to shut down the FLA correctly can cause loss of data. To shutdown the FLA properly, follow these steps.
\\[\baselineskip]
\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}% adapt widths of minipages to your needs

\hfill% 
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth} 
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../media/fla_screens/ethernet_and_others/main/shutdown_complete}
\end{minipage}\\[\baselineskip]


\section{Display Screen Menu System}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA uses the front panel display as the primary way to interact with the unit. This section describes the design of the menu system and how to navigate it.


\section{Menu Screen Descriptions\label{sec:Menu-Screen-Descriptions}}
\paragraph{  }
Almost all of the features of the FLA can be accessed through the
main menu. The only two functions that are not available are the FLA Support Mode, and previewing data, which are solely available on the FLA Preview. Once the FLA boots, the device will enter the main menu, which contains the most used functions, such as running a scan, and uploading data. The below figure describes the layout of the FLA menu system.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../media/graphics/menu_system}
\end{center}
\paragraph{  }
The menu system of the FLA is dynamic, it will only give the operator the option to perform an action if the FLA detects the action is possible. i.e. the FLA will not allow the operator to initiate a vehicle scan if the FLA does not detect any network traffic.


\subsection{Main Menu}

\subsection{Menu Screen Dynamic Lines}

Certain lines of menu screens are dynamic, and display the status
of various components of the FLA.


\subsubsection{IP Address Line}

The IP address Line can have the following states:
\begin{description}
\item [{IP: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX}] A valid IP address. XXX can be any number
between 0 and 255. An example would be 192.168.2.45
\item [{IP: 10.0.0.1}] The IP address when the FLA's DHCP server is activated.
See the DHCP section for more information.
\item [{Ethernet Unplugged}] The FLA cannot detect a live Internet connection.
If this screen persists for more than 60 seconds on a known good Ethernet
port, refer to the troubleshooting section.
\item [{Finding IP Address}] The FLA detected a live Internet connection,
and is searching for an IP address. If this screen persists for more
than 60 seconds on a known good Ethernet port, refer to the troubleshooting
section.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Vehicle Connection Line}

The vehicle connection line displays the status of the vehicle busses.
This line can have the following states:
\begin{description}
\item [{No Vehicle Net / Check Ign. Key}] The FLA is not able to detect
any traffic on the vehicle networks. If this screen persists for more
than 10 seconds, refer to the troubleshooting section.
\item [{CAN Bus only}] The FLA only detects traffic on the CAN bus
\item [{J1708/1587 only}] The FLA only detects traffic on the J1708/1587
bus
\item [{CAN and J1708}] The FLA detects traffic on both the CAN and J1708
busses
\end{description}

\subsection{Connect the FLA to the Internet}
\paragraph{  }
Connecting the FLA to the Internet allows the device to get updates,
set the system time, and upload data to the FLA Portal. To connect the FLA to the Internet follow these steps.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Plug the FLA into a functional Ethernet port using the included Ethernet cable.
\item The FLA should display an IP address on the second line of the title
screen, the screen that is displayed right after the FLA finishes
booting.
\item If the FLA displays ``Ethernet Unplugged'' or ``Finding IP Address''
for more than 60 seconds, consult the troubleshooting section.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Setting the Time}
\paragraph{  }
Once connected to the Internet, the Forensic Link Adapter can synchronize
with universal time using a dedicated time server. This step is only
necessary if the time displayed on the title screen is not the correct
time.
To correct the FLA time, follow these steps.

\subsection{Updating the FLA}
\paragraph{  }
Updating the FLA provides the latest software, with the most features
and highest chance of getting the most data. It is good practice to
perform an update before downloading a vehicle, or before going out
in the field to download.
To perform an update, follow these steps.
\\[\baselineskip]

\chapter{Setting Up the FLA}
\section{In the Office Use}\label{sec:setting_fla_in_office}
\paragraph{  }
When the FLA is in use at the office, ensure the DHCP server is off. If left on, this can cause problems with the network the FLA is plugged into.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{../media/graphics/fla_in_office}
\end{center}
\paragraph{  }
When the FLA is being used with a foreign network, such as any network that is not your home or work network, extra caution must be taken. The local site can be accessed by anyone on the same network, so caution must be taken when using foreign networks. It is not recommended to plug the FLA into an unknown network.
\section{At Home Use}\label{sec:setting_fla_at_home}
\paragraph{  }
When the FLA is in use at a home, or other non-commercial site with an Internet connection, the DHCP server should be turned off. If left on, it can cause problems with the network the FLA is connected to.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{../media/graphics/fla_at_home}
\end{center}
\section{In Field Use}\label{setting_fla_in_field}
\paragraph{  }
When the FLA is being used in the field, the DHCP services may be tuned on. These services allow the user to connect a computer directly to the FLA using the provided Ethernet connection. For more information on DHCP services, refer to section \ref{sec:dhcp_service}.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{../media/graphics/fla_in_field}
\end{center}


\chapter{The FLA Preview}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA Preview is a website that each FLA hosts. This allows operators
to interact with the FLA in ways the front panel are not conducive
for, such as previewing reports.


\section{Accessing the FLA Preview}
\paragraph{  }
Accessing the FLA Preview is done by entering the IP address of the
FLA into a web browser. Please see the requirements section for more
information about supported web browsers. As shown below, enter the
IP Address exactly as it appears on the IP Address line.
\\[\baselineskip]
\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}% adapt widths of minipages to your needs 
	%\begin{center} 
	%	\textbf{Correct:}\\[\baselineskip]

\hfill% 
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth} 
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../media/fla_screens/ethernet_and_others/main/title_no_net}
\end{minipage}
\\[\baselineskip]
This will load the FLA Preview main page, shown below.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{../media/fla_preview_screenshots/main_page}
\end{center}
\paragraph{  }
This page provides an overview of the current status of the device. The At a glance section will display the number of pending data packages, that is the number of data packages that have been downloaded to the FLA but not yet uploaded to the FLA Portal, and if there is a download
in progress.


\section{Using the FLA Preview}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA Preview has many uses, including allowing operators to preview data in the field, download the User Manuals, download RP1210 drivers, and many other useful tasks we will cover in this section.


\subsection{View Local Data}
\paragraph{  }
Under the View Local Data page, the operator is able to view data
on the FLA. There are two sections to local data, Pending Uploads,
and Archived Data. Pending Uploads will show any data packages that
are ready to be uploaded to the FLA Portal.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{../media/fla_preview_screenshots/local_data}
\end{center}

This page will give an overview of each pending data package. The
OEM data column will be YES if the FLA was able to recover some OEM
data, and NO if the FLA could not. The yellow Archive button will
remove the data package from being uploaded, and move it to the archived section. If an archive is unintentionally archived, the FLA will have to be serviced to retrieve the data. For more information about servicing the FLA, see the Service section.
\paragraph{  }
When a download is in progress, the row for that entry will indicate the download is in progress, and will not provide the ``View Data'' button. Once the user finishes the download, the operator can refresh the page, and will see the ``View Data'' button. For more information about when a download is finished, and how to perform a download, refer to the Field Guide.
\paragraph{  }
Selecting the ``View Data'' will provide the user with a preview of the report. This preview includes all of the standards-based information, the components found, and any identification information, as well as any in-field non-standards-based previews. Non-standards-based information is any data that is provided by OEM software, such as DDEC reports' XTR files, and CAT Snapshots. The operator will get a preview of this data here in accordance with the type of ECM being analyzed. The full reports will be available through the FLA Portal when the operator uploads the data. Typically, the following will be available:
\\[\baselineskip]
\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}% adapt widths of minipages to your needs 
	\begin{center} 
		\textbf{Preview of DDEC ECMs}\\[\baselineskip] 
	\end{center} 
	If non-standards-based data is collected from a DDEC ECM, an XTR file will be available for download.
\end{minipage}% 
\hfill% 
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth} 
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../media/fla_preview_screenshots/xtr_download}
\end{minipage}\\[\baselineskip]
\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}% adapt widths of minipages to your needs 
	\begin{center} 
		\textbf{Preview of CAT ECMs}\\[\baselineskip] 
	\end{center}
	If non-standards-based data is collected from a CAT ECM, a CSV file will be available containing 5 frames around the trigger for any quick stop records.
\end{minipage}% 
\hfill% 
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth} 
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../media/fla_preview_screenshots/csv_download}
\end{minipage}
\\[\baselineskip]
\paragraph{  }
The preview will also contain a SHA 256 Sums file for the operator
to download. This file contains the SHA 256 sums of all data files
the FLA has created. The operator can download this file, and confirm
the data uploaded to the FLA Portal was the same data the FLA created.
For more information on SHA 256 sums, as well as recommended use,
see the SHA 256 sums of suggested practices.
\paragraph{  }
The operator can also click on the ``Archived Data'' button on the
View Local Data page to view data packages that were archived. Data
packages that are uploaded to the FLA Portal are automatically archived.
From here the user can access all of the same downloads and information
as when the data package was pending uploading. Meaning, once the
data is uploaded, the user can still download XTR, CSV, or SHA 256
Sum files, as well as any standards-based data acquired. If the FLA
has a large number of archived data packages, the archived page may
take several moments to load.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{../media/fla_preview_screenshots/archived_data}
\end{center}


\chapter{Using the FLA Portal}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA Portal is where operators can view full reports of the data
they collected in the field. Administrators will also use the FLA
Portal to manage FLAs, and users.


\section{Accessing the FLA Portal}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA Portal is accessed by navigating to \href{https://fla.synercontechnologies.com/}{https://fla.synercontechnologies.com/}
in a supported web browser. For a list of supported web browsers, refer to the
XXX section.
\paragraph{  }
The FLA Portal will require the operator to login, using the username and password used when the operator created the account. Note that BOTH username and password are case-sensitive.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../media/fla_portal_screenshots/login_screen}
\end{center}

Once logged in, the operator will be able to view data acquired from
the assigned FLA.


\section{Using the FLA Portal}
\paragraph{  }
For operators, the main use of the FLA Portal is to view full reports. Administrators should refer to the Administrative Guide for further information about administrating on the FLA Portal.
\paragraph{  }
Once an operator uploaded a data package to the FLA Portal, the data will be available for viewing by everyone in the group. A Logged-in operator will be able to view all data packages uploaded to the server.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../media/fla_portal_screenshots/user_landing_page}
\end{center}

Selecting one of these reports will open the full report.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../media/fla_portal_screenshots/full_report/top}
\end{center}

The FLA full report has many sections, including those listed in the next sections.


\subsection{Vehicle Information}

This section contains any components that responded to a component
Identification request. The VIN, Vehicle Odometer, and Engine Hours
will also be displayed under Engine \#1 for the appropriate network.
This section also contains the time records, including vehicle time
if available, and time of the last GPS Lock.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../media/fla_portal_screenshots/full_report/vehicle_info}
\end{center}


\subsection{Data sections}
\paragraph{  }
Data sections, such as Historical Data, Event Data, etc., are sections that contain either standards-based data, or non-standards-based data. These sections contain all of the data the FLA has decoded. Due to the wide variety of ECMs, and ECM configurations, these sections may contain different data depending on the ECM being analyzed.


\subsection{Nomenclature}
\paragraph{  }
This section contains a brief overview of the nomenclature used in
the report.


\subsection{Network Logs}
\paragraph{  }
This section contains the logs of all of the FLA's interactions with
the ECMs. These logs are provided as a means to audit the messages
being sent. If the RP1210 passthrough is engaged, separate logs for
any passthrough transactions will be available.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../media/fla_portal_screenshots/full_report/network_logs}
\end{center}



\subsection{Version Information}

This section provides the software versions that were used when the
report was generated.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../media/fla_portal_screenshots/full_report/version_info}
\end{center}


\subsection{SHA 256 Sums}
\paragraph{  }
This section provides the SHA 256 Sums for all of the data files the
FLA generated when the download was performed. These sums are encrypted
and sent to the FLA Portal for verification. The FLA Portal will generate
its own SHA 256 Sums of the data files uploaded by the FLA. The FLA
Portal will then compare the two, and verify the integrity of the
upload.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../media/fla_portal_screenshots/full_report/valid_shas}
\end{center}
If there is a SHA 256 Mismatch, this may suggest the data has been
tampered with.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../media/fla_portal_screenshots/full_report/invalid_shas}
\end{center}


\subsection{Access Information}

This section provides an audit of who is currently accessing the report,
and the device's IP address.

\\[\baselineskip]
From this screen, select update. A confirmation screen will appear to prevent accidental updates.\newline
After the update completes, the FLA will require a shutdown. Select "Shutdown" to shut the device down before unplugging it. After the devices indicates it is safe to do so, unplug the power supply. After waiting 10 seconds, plug the device in to continue.
\paragraph{  }
If time displayed on the FLA is not correct, the time can be updated through the configuration menu. As with the update, an Internet connection is required. The timezone of the FLA can also be changed in the system configuration menu. For more information about setting the time and timezone, refer to the FLA User Manual.
\section{Download Appropriate Drivers}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA can act as an RP-1210 device for using OEM software. This only required if the ECM being downloaded is not supported. For a list of supported modules, refer to the FLA User Manual. The drivers for the RP-1210 feature of the FLA can be found either at Dearborn Group's website
\url{http://www.dgtech.com/product/dpa/software/DPA4P_136.zip} 
Or on the FLA Preview site.
\paragraph{  }
The FLA Preview site is a website that is generated by the FLA. To access it, first ensure it is powered on, and has an IP address. This can be confirmed by the title screen shown below.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{../media/fla_screens/ethernet_and_others/main/title_both}\label{fig:fla_title_screen}
\end{center}
On a computer connected to the same network, type the IP address into a web browser. The following page should appear.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../media/fla_preview_screenshots/main_page}\label{fig:preview_main_page}
\end{center}
From this page, select Download Drivers, and then the Download button. The Download Drivers page also has testing instructions to verify RP 1210 is working correctly. This site can be accessed without an Internet connection, as the website is generated by the FLA. For connecting to the site in the field, see section \ref{setting_fla_in_field}.
\section{Manufacturer Software}
If the ECM being downloaded is not supported by the FLA, please ensure a computer has a working copy of the OEM software, and also the RP1210 drivers discussed in the previous section.

\chapter{Downloading ECMs}
\paragraph{  }
Downloading ECMs will require the FLA, the vehicle to download or the ECMs and a Smart Sensor Simulator, and permission to perform the download.
\\
These are the general steps to perform a download. Some screens may be different depending on the type of ECM being downloaded.

\section{Supported ECMs}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA can extract more data from supported ECMs, such as event data and other non-standards based data. For a list of supported ECMs, refer to the FLA User Manual. Continuing from screen 8.a from the previous section, select 'Get Data' to continue the non-standards based data extraction. During the extraction, the FLA will display the current status of the extraction. The extraction make take some time, so please wait for the FLA to indicate it is finished. Once completed, the FLA will ask the user if they wish to enable RP1210 mode, or continue to the upload screen. If desired, the FLA can also enable RP1210 mode after performing an extraction. See section~\ref{subsec:upload_data} for more details on uploading data.

\section{Non supported ECMs}
\paragraph{  }
If the FLA is not able to extract data from the ECM, the user can enable RP1210 mode and use the FLA as a passthrough device with the appropriate OEM software.

\chapter{Verifying Data in the Field}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA is able to give the user an overview of the data collected in the field through the FLA Preview. The FLA Preview is a website generated by the FLA that allows the user to connect to the device and examine data on it.
\section{Accessing the FLA Preview}
There are two ways to access the FLA Preview depending on what is available. If a good Ethernet port is available, connect using the at-home/in-office method. If no Ethernet port is available, connect to the preview using the in-field method.
\paragraph{  }
\subsection{At-Home/In-Office}
If the operator is in an office, or at home, they can set the FLA up for home use, section \ref{sec:setting_fla_at_home}, or for office use \ref{sec:setting_fla_in_office}. Enter the IP address from the title screen into a web browser. This will take you to the FLA Preview website. If you have trouble accessing the preview, refer to the troubleshooting section.
\\[\baselineskip]

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../media/fla_screens/ethernet_and_others/main/title_both}
\end{minipage}
\subsection{In-Field}
\paragraph{  }
The first step in accessing the FLA Preview is to have the FLA in the correct mode. Unless the operator wishes to place the FLA in support mode, the easiest way to access the FLA Preview is to set up the FLA for the field, as described in section \ref{setting_fla_in_field}. Once the FLA has DHCP enabled, and the computer is directly connected to the FLA with the Ethernet cable, enter "10.0.0.1" into a web browser. This will take you to the FLA Preview website.

\end{minipage}
\section{Using the FLA Preview}
\paragraph{}
The main page of the FLA will show the user how many pending data packages there are on the FLA, as well as if there are any downloads in progress. Under the View Local Data page, the operator can view the data packages that are not yet uploaded to the Synercon Server.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../media/fla_preview_screenshots/local_data}
\end{center}
\paragraph{  }
This page gives a brief overview of each data package on the FLA that is not yet uploaded. The OEM data column indicates if the FLA has extracted data from the engine that is not a part of the standards-based extraction. From this page the operator can view the data from an individual data, view archived data packages, or archive pending data packages.
\paragraph{  }
\textbf{Archiving a pending data package will move the data package to the archived list, and it will NOT be uploaded to the server.}
This is only to be used when the operator has a pending data package they do not want to upload on the server, i.e. if it was a practice download, or it contains incomplete data due to a lose cable. Use this with care, archived data packages cannot be un-archived without Synercon support.
\paragraph{  }
The View Data button will allow the operator to view a preview of the report. This will contain all of the standards-based messages, as well as standards-based faults. If the FLA was able to collect non-standards-based data a portion of the decoded data will be available for download. The full records will be available once the operator uploads the data to the Synercon Portal.
\paragraph{  }
The operator can also view archived data with the button at the bottom. Note, the archived page can take some time to load.

Under each report, the user can download the SHA256 Sums file.
This file contains the SHA 256 sums of all of the files the FLA generated at the time of the download. These sums are cryptographic fingerprints of the files that can be used to determine if the file has changed since the FLA created the file. The user can save this file to perform verification of integrity of data obtained. For more information about SHA256 sums, refer to section~\ref{subsec:using_shas}.


\chapter{Administrator's Guide}

This section is intended to teach administrators how to manage FLAs
on the FLA Portal.


\section{FLA Portal terminology}

The FLA Portal has the following categories:
\begin{description}
\item [{Organizations}] are the top level with a site administrator as
the person in charge. Typically this is a highway patrol, a state
police, or a company. The person in charge of the organization has
the ability to oversee the data and use of the different FLAs.
\item [{Groups}] are a sub-level within an organization. For example, East
District and West District may be groups within an State Police organization.
If an organization only has a few operators and a few FLAs, it may
not make sense to have different groups. 
\item [{Operators}] are trained users of the FLA and are responsible for
collecting data in the field. Operators can be assigned to different
groups. Every operator in the group is able to see the data packages
from all the FLAs assigned to the group, regardless of which operators
downloaded the data.
\item [{Forensic~Link~Adapters}] are the hardware devices that an organization
owns.
\end{description}

\section{Account Overview}

Forensic Link Adapters are assigned to each organization at the time
of purchase. Once the organization completes the purchase, the serial
numbers of each FLA will be loaded into the Organization's profile.
An invitation to set up the Organization will be sent to the site
administrator. For example, the Lieutenant in charge of the crash
reconstruction division will become the site administrator once he
or she registers by following the link sent in the invitation e-mail.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../media/fla_portal_screenshots/FLAPortalAccountOverviewScreenShot}

\caption{\label{fig:Example-FLA-Account-overview}Example Forensic Link Adapter
Portal web page for the Account overview}
\end{figure}


Once logged in as a Site Administrator, an account overview page will
be available, much like the one shown in Figure \ref{fig:Example-FLA-Account-overview}.
Many of the fields on the web page are linked to various functions.
The top bar (in black) has links to your default login page, the latest
FLA download if you are an operator, a list of all the organizations,
FLAs, and some account access settings. The web page is set up in
three distinct tables as seen in Figure \ref{fig:Example-FLA-Account-overview}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Organization Groups
\item FLA Operators
\item Forensic Link Adapter (FLA)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Group Management}

It is the responsibility of the Organization administrator to set
up groups and operators according to the desired structure of the
Organization. You can have operators that have access to more than
one group.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../media/fla_portal_screenshots/FLAPortalFieldOperatorsScreenShot}

\caption{\label{fig:Example-Group-Details}Example Group Details web page from
the Forensic Link Adapter Portal.}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Adding an Operator}

There are two ways to get an operator access to the group's FLAs.
The first is to invite a new operator and the second is to invite
an existing operator. However, the existing operator must have accepted
an invitation from the Organization under a unique e-mail address.
By clicking on the lower left box the says \textsf{Invite new operator}
shown in \ref{fig:Example-Group-Details}, a web page similar to
the one shown in \ref{fig:New-Operator-invitation}. The required
user information includes name and email address. The FLA portal uses
e-mail addresses to identify operators. Therefore, if a person belongs
to different organizations, they would have to use a different e-mail
for each organization. New operators will get an e-mail from \texttt{fla-admin@synercontechnologies.com}
with a link to register with the site. Many times this e-mail will
be filtered as junk, so advising the recipient to check their e-mail
filters and junk folder may be necessary.

The Work Address details on the Invite and operator page are used
to fill in a report with 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=10cm]{../media/fla_portal_screenshots/FLAPortalInviteNewOperatorScreenShot}

\caption{\label{fig:New-Operator-invitation}New Operator invitation form on
the FLA portal website.}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Assigning an FLA to the Group}

Each group needs to have at least one Forensic Link Adapter assigned
to it. To assign an FLA to a group, click the button to see a list
of available FLAs for your organization. Only people in the group
can see the data on the FLA assigned to that group

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../media/fla_portal_screenshots/FLAPortalAssignedFLASuccessScreenShot}

\caption{Assigned FLAs}
\end{figure}



\chapter{Obtaining Data}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA can obtain standards-based data from all ECMs that support the J1587 and/or J1939 standards. The FLA can also obtain additional data, such as event data, from specific ECMs.

\section{Supported ECMs}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA can obtain additional information from the following ECMs
\begin{itemize}
\item CAT
\begin{itemize}
\item ADEM 3
\item ADEM 4
\end{itemize}
\item DDEC
\begin{itemize}
\item DDEC IV
\item DDEC V
\item Some DDEC VI
\item Some XXX/XXX
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
It is important to use the FLA to obtain data whenever possible. The OEM software is typically designed with maintenance in mind, not forensic soundness. Most OEM software will allow the user to erase data, while the FLA prevents accidental data loss.

\section{Using Manufacturer's Software}
\paragraph{  }
The FLA is still able to obtain some data from most non-supported ECMs, as long as they support the J1587 and J1939 standards. Additional information is typically available through the manufacturers (OEM's) software. The FLA can operate as a passthrough device, allowing an operator to use a computer with the specific ECM's software to gather additional data.
\paragraph{  }
OEM software varies between manufacturer, so different steps must be taken to collect data depending on the ECM type. Synercon provides Quick References for the most popular ECMs. These quick references will provide guidance for using OEM software.

\chapter{Suggested Practices}
\paragraph{  }
This section is intended to provide a very brief overview of using
the FLA, for a more in-depth guide, refer to the Field Guide.


\section{Initiating FLA Support mode}

In order to provide the quickest and most complete support, it may
be necessary to place the FLA in support mode. This allows Synercon
Support staff to create a secure connection to an FLA anywhere with
an Internet connection. It may also be referred to as a ``Support
Channel''.

To place the FLA in support mode, or ``Open a Support Channel'',
follow these steps
\begin{enumerate}
\item Verify a Synercon Support representative is ready for you to initiate
Support Mode.
\item Connect the FLA to the Internet as described in section XXX.
\item Navigate to the FLA Preview site as described in section XXX.
\item Select the ``Support'' option from the menu at the top.
\item Click the ``Open the support channel'' button to initiate Support
Mode.
\item After a brief period, the page will change to say the connection was
successful, if the connection was not successful, refer to the troubleshooting
section.
\item Do not close the web page, or click the ``Back'' or ``Refresh''
buttons. It is important to stay on this page until the Synercon Support
representative is finished providing support.
\item When the Synercon Support representative begins working on your FLA,
the screen on the device will change to indicate a member is performing
work.
\item When the Synercon Support representative is finished, the unit will
display a message indicating the work is finished.
\item The FLA will automatically reboot.
\item After the device loads the Title Screen, then click the ``Close Support''
button to return the FLA to normal operational mode.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Installing PC Software}


\subsection{RP 1210 Drivers}

The FLA can operate as an RP1210 device. This is used for connecting
OEM software to ECMs. A computer does not need the RP 1210 drivers
to access the FLA Preview, and the FLA Portal. You will need administrative
privileges to install these drivers.

To install the RP1210 Drivers, follow these steps
\begin{enumerate}
\item Connect to the FLA Preview described in the above section (Either In-Field,
or In-Office methods will work)
\item Select the Download Drivers option from the menu at the top of the
web page
\item Select ``Download Drivers''
\item Once the file is downloaded, extract the .zip file to a folder
\item Open the folder, and double-click ``DPA4Plus\_RP1210.exe''
\item Follow the on-screen instructions to install the drivers
\end{enumerate}
After the drivers are installed, they can be tested with the following
steps
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make sure the FLA is powered on, and connected to an ECM (It is possible
to test the drivers without a live ECM, to do so see the special instructions)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Skip steps 2,3,and 4 if not connected to a live ECM
\item Begin a scan on the vehicle
\item After the scan has completed and you see the "Enable
RP1210 Mode" screen
\item Confirm the top line of the FLA read "CAN/J1939 Pass
Mode."
\item Search on your computer for the program "Adapter Validation
Tool" and run it
\item Select "MD/HD"
\item Set the Vendor to "DG1210xx - Dearborn Group RP1210"
(the xx will likely be 32)
\item Set the Device to "DG DPA 4 Plus USB"
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Skip to step 14 if the ECM does not support J1939
\end{enumerate}
\item Set Protocol to "J1939"
\item plug the USB cable into the FLA and the computer
\item Click "Run Test"
\item The text boxes labeled "RP1210 Status Window (PC-VDA)"
and "RP1210 Data Message Window (VDA-Vehicle)"
should turn green

\begin{enumerate}
\item If you are not connected to a live ECM, the "RP1210
Data Message Window" will turn red as there are no messages
\end{enumerate}
\item A text box will appear and will describe the results of the test.
\item Click "Quit" on the pop-up window titled
"Test Results Discussion"

\begin{enumerate}
\item If the ECM does not support J1708, the test is complete.If it does,
continue
\end{enumerate}
\item Change the protocol to J1708
\item On the FLA click the Green button to enable J1708 passthrough
\item Confirm the top line of the FLA read "J1708 Pass Mode
for"
\item Click "Run Test"
\item A text box will appear and will describe the results of the test
\item Click "Quit" on the pop-up window titled
"Test Results Discussion"
\item Close out of the adapter validation test
\end{enumerate}

\section{Preforming a download on a Heavy Vehicle}

This section provides a very high level overview of a typical download.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Plug in the FLA to the 9-Pin Diagnostics Connector
\item Turn on the ignition key to run
\item Run a vehicle Scan
\item Download Supported Data (if available)
\item Enable RP1210 Mode (Optional depending on the ECM and user's procedure)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Connect the USB Cable
\item Run OEM Software
\end{enumerate}
\item Verify the data collected via the FLA Preview

\begin{enumerate}
\item If desired, repeat steps 3-6 until satisfied

\item Shutdown the FLA
\item Reach a location that has a working Ethernet port
\item Connect the FLA to the Internet
\item Upload the data from the field
\item View the full report on the FLA Portal
\end{enumerate}

\section{Connecting to Engine Control Modules on a Bench}

When performing bench downloads, it is recommended to use a Smart
Sensor Simulator to minimize the chance of throwing additional faults
as compared to a traditional calibration harness. For more information
about Smart Sensor Simulators, visit \textbackslash{}url\{synercontechnologies.com\}.
Once connected, use the FLA in accordance to the recommended practices
outlined in the Field Guide and accompanying Quick Start guides.

The following are typical steps taken during a download.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Confirm the correct SSS is being used for the ECM
\item Connect the SSS to the ECM
\item Connect power to the SSS via the included power adapter
\item Press the Key Switch until the Key On lamp is illuminated, about two
seconds
\item Verify the Key On lamp stays illuminated for one second before proceeding.
If not, refer to the troubleshooting section
\item Plug in the FLA to the 9-Pin Diagnostics Connector located on the
SSS
\item Run a vehicle Scan
\item Download Supported Data (if available)
\item Enable RP1210 Mode (Optional depending on the ECM and user's procedure)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Connect the USB Cable
\item Run OEM Software
\end{enumerate}
\item Verify the data collected via the FLA Preview

\begin{enumerate}
\item If desired, repeat steps 3-6 until satisfied
\item Skip to step 13 if there is a working Ethernet port where the bench
download is occurring
\end{enumerate}
\item Shutdown the FLA
\item Reach a location that has a working Ethernet port
\item Connect the FLA to the Internet
\item Upload the data from the field
\item View the full report on the FLA Portal
\end{enumerate}


\part{General Information}


\chapter{Troubleshooting}

\section{Vehicle Connection Problems}
\subsection{Do not get the Option to Scan Vehicle}
Symptom:\\
\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}% adapt widths of minipages to your needs
The FLA Title Screen does not allow the user to scan the vehicle
\end{minipage}%
\hfill%
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../media/fla_screens/ethernet_and_others/main/title_no_net}
\end{minipage}\\
Solution:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Check that the key is in the ON position, with the engine not running.
\item Check to see if the vehicle voltage is nominal, low voltage may prevent ECMs from responding.
\item Check all cables for secure connections.
\end{itemize}
If the above list does not solve the issue, the communication wires from the ECM to the diagnostic port may be damaged. If this is the case, the ECM modules may have to be removed and the operator may have to perform a bench download on the unit. The recommended practice is to use a Synercon Smart Sensor Simulator with the truck ECMs in order to help preserve the data on the modules.
\section{FLA Internet Problems}
\subsection{Cannot access the FLA Preview website}
Symptom:\\
The operator is not able to access the FLA Preview website.
Solution:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item navigate to the title screen and verify the FLA has an IP address. If the IP line reads 'cable unplugged', or 'finding IP address', see the FLA Does not have an IP Address section.
\item If the FLA is not connected directly to a computer (i.e. the FLA is plugged into an Ethernet port in an office, or home) ensure the DHCP service is off. If the IP address of the FLA is 10.0.0.1, the DHCP service is likely on. For more information about the DHCP service, see section~\ref{subsec:dhcp_services}.
\item Ensure the operator has typed in the IP address exactly as it appears on the FLA, do not add any extra characters, such as leading zeros before the numbers, or extra spaces.
\end{itemize}

\hfill%
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../media/fla_screens/ethernet_and_others/main/title_no_net}
\end{minipage}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure the FLA is on the same network as the computer used to access it. Depending on the configuration, if the computer is connected to a wireless network, try to plug into an Ethernet cable near the port the FLA is plugged into.
\end{itemize}
If the above steps do not resolve the problem, the operator may need to contact the department IT services. If they are not able to resolve the issue, please contact Synercon support.

\subsection{FLA Does not Have an IP Address}
\subsubsection{IP says Ethernet Unplugged}
Symptom:\\
\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}% adapt widths of minipages to your needs
The IP line of the FLA Title screen says Ethernet Unplugged
\end{minipage}%
\hfill%
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../media/fla_screens/no_ethernet/title_both}
\end{minipage}\\
Solution:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Check cables are plugged in all the way.
\item Reboot the FLA with the Ethernet cable plugged in.
\item Verify the port is working with a computer.
\item Contact your department IT services, and ensure the FLA is given the permissions to access the Internet. Often this is done by 'whitelisting a MAC address'. If the operator needs to provide the MAC of the FLA, this can be accessed via the configuration menu. For more information, see section~\ref{subsec:finding_mac}.
\end{itemize}
If the above steps do not solve the issue, the operator may need to contact Synercon support.
\subsubsection{IP says Finding IP Address}
Symptom:\\
\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}% adapt widths of minipages to your needs
The IP line of the FLA Title screen says Ethernet Unplugged
\end{minipage}%
\hfill%
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../media/fla_screens/no_ethernet/title_both_finding_ip}
\end{minipage}\\
Solution:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item If the FLA is being used in the field, and directly connected to a computer, enable the DHCP service. See section~\ref{subsec:dhcp_services}.
\item Reboot the FLA with the Ethernet cable plugged in.
\item Verify the port is working with a computer.
\item Contact your department IT services, and ensure the FLA is given the permissions to access the Internet. Often this is done by 'whitelisting a MAC address'. If the operator needs to provide the MAC of the FLA, this can be accessed via the configuration menu. For more information, see section~\ref{subsec:finding_mac}.
\end{itemize}
\section{FLA Boot Problems}
\subsection{FLA Does not Boot When Plugged in}
Symptom:\\
The FLA does nothing when plugged into a vehicle.
Solution:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item The power wires to the diagnostic port may have been damaged, use the cigarette lighter adapter in the FLA case to provide power to the FLA. It is recommended to carry a portable battery for powering the FLA via battery for such situations.
\end{itemize}
If the FLA will not boot with either the cigarette lighter adapter plugged into a know charged battery, or the wall adapter, please contact Synercon support.
\subsection{FLA Does not finish booting}
Symptom:\\
\noindent\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}% adapt widths of minipages to your needs
The FLA reaches this screen, and does not proceed to the Title screen for more than 30 seconds.
\end{minipage}%
\hfill%
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../media/fla_screens/ethernet_and_others/boot/please_wait}
\end{minipage}\\
Solution:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Wait 30 seconds for the system to attempt to boot.
\item If the system does not boot, remove power sources, wait 30 seconds and then plug the FLA in. Note this is not recommended as a standard method to shut the FLA down, only do this when you have exhausted all other methods to shut the system down safely.
\end{itemize}
If the device continues to fail to boot for more than 2 times, please contact Synercon support.


\chapter{Definitions}

When dealing with heavy truck data, there are many acronyms, symbols
and phrases that are used to describe the data. This chapter presents

%\section{Powering the FLA}


\subsection*{Only use the included wall adapter or cigarette adapter to power
the FLA}

When not using a vehicle to power the FLA, only power the device using
the included power supplies. Never plug in a foreign adapter, especially
if the voltage exceeds 12 volts.


\subsection*{Never plug the FLA into a diagnostic port that has a vehicle voltage
above 26 volts}

When plugging in the FLA to a vehicle, ensure the voltage of the diagnostic
port does not exceed 26 volts. If in doubt, a multi-meter can be used
to verify voltage


\subsection*{Do not remove power from the FLA without first shutting down}

Unless specifically instructed to do so by a troubleshooting guide,
avoid removing power to the FLA without first shutting down. Use the
securing screws of the cables to secure all cables against accidental
disconnection.


\subsection*{Do not expose the FLA to water}

The FLA is NOT waterproof, even powered off. Avoid dropping the unit
in puddles, or exposing the device to rainfall. Take care to ensure
a dry environment is available before operating the FLA. If the unit
is exposed to water, even when powered off, the water can damage the
unit, and potentially any data stored on the unit. If exposed to water,
immediately power the unit off and contact Synercon Support for instructions.


\subsection*{Do not expose to excess heat or cold}

Do not expose the FLA to temperatures exceeding 50C (122F), or below
0C (-32F).
