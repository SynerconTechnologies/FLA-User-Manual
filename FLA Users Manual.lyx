\end_inset

The Program Loading screen shows the user that the FLA booted successfully
 and is loading the program needed to interface with the user through the
 display.
 It also sets up the files and directories for the current session.
 A few things happen in the background while this screen is present:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The FLA system time is updated.
 If an Internet connection is available (i.e.
 the Ethernet cable is plugged into a known good network), then the FLA
 will get its system time from the network time server at NIST.
 Once it automatically updates the time, it also updates the time on its
 battery powered real time clock (RTC).
 If an Internet connection is not available, then the system time is updated
 from the RTC.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The FLA tries to obtain a GPS lock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The FLA looks to see if vehicle networks are present.
 It detects the presence of network traffic on the J1708 network (9600 baud)
 and the J1939 network (CAN bus).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "enu:Status"

\end_inset

The first line of the Status Screen shows the current time with the time
 zone.
 The system time zone can be changed from the web interface, as described
 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:Setting-the-Timezone"

\end_inset

.
 The second line of the status screen shows the status of the Ethernet connectio
n, as described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to remind the operator that the ignition key switch must be turned to the
 on or run position for network traffic to be present.
 If the key is on, sufficient power is available, and no vehicle networks
 are present, then the vehicle network may be compromised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "enu:StatusB"

\end_inset

CAN Bus Only means that messages using the Controller Area Network are present.
 Since SAE J1939 specifies CAN as the network, this detects the presence
 of J1939 messages.
 J1708 network traffic was not detected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "enu:StatusC"

\end_inset

1708/1587 means no CAN or J1939 messages are present on the vehicle networks.
 This may be the case for older vehicles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "enu:StatusD"

\end_inset

CAN and J1708 mean both networks are present and have traffic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system voltage is also displayed as detected by a voltage divider connected
 to the main processor.
 This voltage indication is not calibrated, but should give the user some
 feedback on the health of the vehicle system voltage.
 On the bottom line, there are button commands and an indicator showing
 the number of GPS satellites.
 The Red button advances the FLA to the next screen.
 The Green button starts the scan of the vehicle network to identify the

 This screen enables the operator to turn the FLA into a Dynamic Host Configurat
ion Protocol (DHCP) server and give IP addresses to other computers on the
 network.
 Since only one DHCP server should be on a network at a time, this feature
 off by default.
 However, in the field, the FLA may need to set up an FLA network so the
 operator can connect to the FLA web page.
 The following descriptions explain how to enable and disable the DHCP server.

 If the words

 that may be available and useful, as explained in further detail in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

The ECM Identification screen shows the identification information stored
 in the first Engine ECM.
 The ECM make (AAAAA) and model (MMMMMMMM) comes from requesting the Component
 Identification.
 The Component Identification is a J1587 message with PID of 241 or a J1939
 message with SPNs 586 and 587.
 The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) comes from J1587 PID 237 or J1939
 SPN 237.
 These data may or may not be present depending on how the ECM is programmed.
 If the data are not present from the Engine ECM, then the next source is
 used, if available.

The RP1210 passthrough mode enables operators to use other PC based software
 to interface with the vehicle.
 The FLA will be connected to a PC by a USB cable to communicate on the
 vehicle bus.
 The FLA uses a DGTech eDPA to communicate with the PC.
 As such, it is important to have the DG Drivers installed before using
 the RP1210 mode, as described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:RP1210-Drivers"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This page will give an overview of each pending data package.
 The OEM data column will be YES if the FLA was able to recover some OEM
 data, and NO if the FLA could not.
 The yellow Archive button will remove the data package from being uploaded,
 and move it to the archived section.
 If an archive is unintentionally archived, the FLA will have to be serviced
 to retrieve the data.
 For more information about servicing the FLA, see the Service section.

 will provide the user with a preview of the report.
 This preview includes all of the standards-based information, the components
 found, and any identification information, as well as any in-field non-standard
s-based previews.
 Non-standards-based information is any data that is provided by OEM software,
 such as DDEC reports' XTR files, and CAT Snapshots.
 The operator will get a pireview of this data here in accordance with the
 type of ECM being analyzed.
 The full reports will be avaliable through the FLA Portal when the operator
 uploads the data.
 Typically, the following will be avaliable:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Preview of DDEC ECMs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If non-standards-based data is collected from a DDEC ECM, an XTR file will
 be avaliable for download.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Preview of CAT ECMs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If non-standars-based data is collected from a CAT ECM, a CSV file will
 be avaliable containing 5 frames around the trigger for any quick stop
 records.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The preview will also contain a SHA 256 Sums file for the operator to download.
 This file contains the SHA 256 sums of all data files the FLA has created.
 The operator can download this file, and confirm the data uploaded to the
 FLA Portal was the same data the FLA created.
 For more information on SHA 256 sums, as well as recommended use, see the
 SHA 256 sums of suggested practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The operator can also click on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Archived Data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button on the View Local Data page to view data packages that were archived.
 Data packages that are uploaded to the FLA Portal are automatically archived.
 From here the user can access all of the same downloads and information
 as when the data package was pending uploading.
 Meaning, once the data is uploaded, the user can still downloa XTR, CSV,
 or SHA 256 Sum files, as well as any standards-based data aquired.
 If the FLA has a large number of archived data packages, the archived page
 may take several moments to load.

 FLA Portal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
FLA Portal terminology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The FLA Portal has the following categories:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Organizations are the top level with a site administrator as the person
 in charge.
 Typically this is a highway patrol, a state police, or a company.
 The person in charge of the organization has the ability to oversee the
 data and use of the different FLAs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Groups are a sub-level within an organization.
 For example, East District and West District may be groups within an State
 Police organization.
 If an organization only has a few operators and a few FLAs, it may not
 make sense to have different groups.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Operators are trained users of the FLA and are responsible for collecting
 data in the field.
 Operators can be assigned to different groups.
 Every operator in the group is able to see the data packages from all the
 FLAs assigned to the group, regardless of which operators downloaded the
 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Forensic
\begin_inset space ~

Link
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Adapters are the hardware devices that an organization owns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Account Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Forensic Link Adapters are assigned to each organization at the time of
 purchase.
 Once the organization completes the purchase, the serial numbers of each
 FLA will be loaded into the Organization's profile.
 An invitation to set up the Organization will be sent to the site administrator.
 For example, the Lieutenant in charge of the crash reconstruction division
 will become the site administrator once he or she registers by following
 the link sent in the invitation e-mail.

Adding an Operator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways to get an operator access to the group's FLAs.
 The first is to invite a new operator and the second is to invite an existing
 operator.
 However, the existing operator must have accepted an invitation from the
 Organization under a unique e-mail address.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "fig:New-Operator-invitation"

\end_inset

.
 The required user information includes name and email address.
 The FLA portal uses e-mail addresses to identify operators.
 Therefore, if a person belongs to different organizations, they would have
 to use a different e-mail for each organization.
 New operators will get an e-mail from 
\family typewriter
fla-admin@synercontechnologies.com
\family default
 with a link to register with the site.
 Many times this e-mail will be filtered as junk, so advising the recipient
 to check their e-mail filters and junk folder may be necessary.
